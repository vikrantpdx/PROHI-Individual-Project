This project is a simple dashboard created during the DSHI course. 
The main objective was to practice data visualization and presentation. 
We used synthetic data to demonstrate interactive widgets, tables, and charts. 
Although the data is not real, the structure mimics a real-life data science dashboard, 
allowing users to input values, visualize datasets, and see trends in charts. 
This mini-project showcases the ability to build user-friendly interfaces 
for data exploration and reporting.
