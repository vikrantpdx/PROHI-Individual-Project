For the DSHI course, I completed a project analyzing health data to predict the 
occurrence of heart disease. I preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, 
normalizing continuous features, and encoding categorical variables. Using Python 
and libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, I formulated analytical 
questions, explored patterns through visualizations, and tested multiple models, 
including logistic regression and random forests. I evaluated model performance using 
cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure
reliability. The analysis highlighted key predictors, including exercise habits, 
cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. This project strengthened my skills in data 
preprocessing, visualization, model evaluation, and critical interpretation, while 
demonstrating how predictive modeling can support early detection and informed 
decision-making in a real-world healthcare setting.
